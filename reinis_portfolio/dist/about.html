          Hello, my name is Reinis. I'm a Technology loving person with good
          analytical skills and experience in tech industry over a variety of roles.
          most recently working as a BE engineer, using PHP I developed the backend
          behind a cloud-based insurance system. This involved designing, creating and maintaining
          new microservices, creating new APIs and integrating third party APIs while at 
          the same time keeping up with best engineering practises and making sure my code was
          covered with tests as much as possible. This experience has
          helped me grow substantially, and now I'm looking to expand and share my knowledge elsewhere.
